In order to build the activity executables, the user must have CMake installed. Additionally, the build system assumes that a C++20 compatible MinGW compiler is installed.

To build a given activity, run the terminal command `build.bat activity_dir` in the root of the cloned repository, where "activity_dir" is the directory of the activity you wish to build. 
The executable can then be found in  ./activity_dir/build/
